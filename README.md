This repository contains the project report and Verilog codes for a high-precision LDO voltage reference implemented in the SG13G2 130 nm BiCMOS process. The design features a curvature-compensated Brokaw bandgap reference with IÂ²C-based digital trimming(using single iteration/using binary search), a folded cascode amplifier with flipped voltage follower buffer for 100 mA load support, and loop stabilization using Miller compensation. Simulation results include line/load regulation, quiescent current, and temperature performance analysis.
